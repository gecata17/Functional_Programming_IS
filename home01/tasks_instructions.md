# Task 1

Define two predicates that return whether a number is even:

    using if-else;

    using guards.

    Test cases:

     print $ isEvenIf 2 == "Yes"
     print $ isEvenIf 15452 == "Yes"
     print $ isEvenIf 321 == "No"
     print $ isEvenGuards 2 == "Yes"
     print $ isEvenGuards 15452 == "Yes"
     print $ isEvenGuards 321 == "No"

# Task 2

Define two functions that return the sum of the cubes of two whole numbers:

    using a power operator;

    without using a power operator.

    Test cases:

     print $ sumCubesPow 5 1 == 126
     print $ sumCubesPow 10 50 == 126000

     print $ sumCubesNoPow 5 1 == 126
     print $ sumCubesNoPow 10 50 == 126000

# Task 3

Define a function that returns the average of the sum of the squares of two whole numbers.

Test cases:

print $ sqAvg 5 0 == 12.5
print $ sqAvg 10 13 == 134.5

# Task 4

Define a function for calculating the GCD of two whole numbers. Use guards!

Recap:

The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(x,y) is as follows:
If x = 0 then GCD(x,y)=y.
If y = 0 then GCD(x,y)=x.
Write x in quotient remainder form (x = Aâ‹…y + R). Find GCD(y,R) (since GCD(x,y)=GCD(y,R)).

Test cases:

print $ myGcd 5 13 == 1
print $ myGcd 13 1235 == 13

# Task 5

Define two predicates that check whether a year is a leap year.

The first should be called isLeapYearOneLine. It should implement Method I using boolean logical operators.

The second should be called isLeapYearGuards. It should implement Method II using guards.

Recap:

Method I:
    A year is leap year if the following conditions are satisfied:
        Year is multiple of 400.
        Year is multiple of 4 and not multiple of 100.

Method II:
    if year is divisible by 400 then is_leap_year
    else if year is divisible by 100 then not_leap_year
    else if year is divisible by 4 then is_leap_year
    else not_leap_year 

Test cases:

print $ isLeapYearOneLine 2020 == True
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 1988 == True
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 1600 == True
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 2400 == True
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 2023 == False
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 1700 == False
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 1800 == False
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 2100 == False

print $ isLeapYearGuards 2020 == True
print $ isLeapYearGuards 1988 == True
print $ isLeapYearGuards 1600 == True
print $ isLeapYearGuards 2400 == True
print $ isLeapYearGuards 2023 == False
print $ isLeapYearGuards 1700 == False
print $ isLeapYearGuards 1800 == False
print $ isLeapYearGuards 2100 == False

# Task 6

John has a backpack. With it he can carry k kilograms. An item from the supermarket weighs w kilograms. Define a function that accepts three numbers - c (number of products), k and w and returns whether John is capable of buying all the products in one trip to the supermarket.

Implementation detail:

Use guards!

Test cases:

print $ canCarry 5 15 3 == "Yes"
print $ canCarry 1 5 4 == "Yes"
print $ canCarry 13 25 2 == "No"
print $ canCarry 24 104.44 21.12 == "No"
print $ canCarry 51 34.75 19.852 == "No"
print $ canCarry 42 95.11 0.51 == "Yes"
--print $ canCarry (-13) 25 2 -- error: The number of products was negative
--print $ canCarry 13 (-25) 2 -- error: John's hosting capacity was negative
--print $ canCarry 13 25 (-2) -- error: The weight of a product was negative

# Task 7

Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters. Each night that plants height decreases by downSpeed meters due to the lack of sun light. Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.

Test cases:

print $ growingPlant 5 2 5 == 1
print $ growingPlant 5 2 6 == 2
print $ growingPlant 10 9 4 == 1
print $ growingPlant 100 10 910 == 10

Explanations:

For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10 and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be 10.

After day 1   --> 100
After night 1 --> 90
After day 2   --> 190
After night 2 --> 180
After day 3   --> 280
After night 3 --> 270
After day 4   --> 370
After night 4 --> 360
After day 5   --> 460
After night 5 --> 450
After day 6   --> 550
After night 6 --> 540
After day 7   --> 640
After night 7 --> 630
After day 8   --> 730
After night 8 --> 720
After day 9   --> 820
After night 9 --> 810
After day 10  --> 910 

For upSpeed = 10, downSpeed = 9 and desiredHeight = 4, the output should be 1.

Because the plant reaches the desired height at day 1 (10 meters).

After day 1 --> 10

# Task 8

A snail crawls up a column. During the day it crawls up some distance. During the night it sleeps, so it slides down for some distance (less than it crawls up during the day).

Your function accepts three arguments:

    The height of the column (meters);
    The distance that the snail crawls during the day (meters);
    The distance that the snail slides down during the night (meters).

Calculate number of days the snail will need to reach the top of the column.

Test cases:

print $ snail 3 2 1 == 2
print $ snail 10 3 1 == 5
print $ snail 10 3 2 == 8
print $ snail 100 20 5 == 7
print $ snail 5 10 3 == 1

# Task 9

Define a function that reverses a non-negative number by implementing a linearly iterative process.

Test cases:

print $ rev 1 == 1
print $ rev 123 == 321
print $ rev 987654321 == 123456789
